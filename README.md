# Javascript Playground

I have always wondered how web-based javascript prototyping tools like [jsbin](jsbin.com), work. So, I made one, then I put more stuff in it, because I wanted something between codepen and . Playground features:

Current 

Phosphor desktop-like, themable UI with resizable and draggable panels 
Multiple javascript panels per sketch - break up your experiment into multiple pieces 
use libraries via require() or script tags
Multiple CSS panels per sketch
Runkit Endpoint panel for scripting runkit-hosted endpoints
Runkit runner panel as a server-side scratch pad
Saves state to localstorage

Planned 

virtual file system. Mount your data sources as file systems
Supports all the latest JS bells and whistles with dynamic Babel transpiling
Fully decentralized data storage - store your worspaces on the decentralized web 
Publish sketch to IPFS - publish your entire sketch to IPFS for fully decentralized hosting and delivery
Social sharing - follow other users, 


### How to run

```javascript
npm install -g parcel
npm install
npm start
```
